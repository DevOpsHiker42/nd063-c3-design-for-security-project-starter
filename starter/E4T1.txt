# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

1. WebAppSG security group should be modified to only allow inbound traffic coming from the Application Load Balancer on port 5000.
   N.B. AWS Systems Manager Session Manager can be used for managing the server without the need to have the SSH port (22) open.
2. Update VPC Network ACL to deny inbound traffic on port 22 (except for specific known IP addresses if required).
3. Move the Web Service Instance into the private subnet and use a NAT gateway to handle outbound traffic.


# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

- An IAM role could be created with permissions to the bucket, such that trusted users can assume the role when they need to access the bucket.
  All other public access should be blocked.
