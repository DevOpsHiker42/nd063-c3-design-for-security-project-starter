# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

- Move the Web Service Instance into the private subnet and use a NAT gateway if required to handle outbound traffic.
- Add rules (with numbers < 100) to the network ACL for the 'moms-kithen-web-service' VPC to deny ports 22 (SSH) and 3389 (RDP).
  EC2 instances could be managed via AWS Systems Manager to avoid the need to have port 22 open.
- Change to HTTPS instead of HTTP for inbound web traffic.
- Enable the setting routing.http.drop_invalid_header_fields on load balancer c1-web-service-alb.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

Unauthorized access to the secrets bucket was from an attack instance within the VPC, so VPC private endpoints on their own would not prevent this.
Using a VPC private endpoint on the secrets bucket could potentially be very beneficial as part of a wider security strategy, but would need to be combined with:
- IAM permissions
- An alternative method for privileged users to be able to access the secret recipes from outside the VPC, assuming public access was being turned off in favour of private endpoints.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No, updating this setting only affects new objects.
Starting January 5, 2023, all new object uploads to Amazon S3 will be automatically encrypted - see:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/default-bucket-encryption.html

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

Any manually-applied changes ('configuration drift') will be lost as the resources will return to their configurations as specified in the templates.
