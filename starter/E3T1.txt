# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Despite many attempts, GuardDuty seemingly failed to detect the brute force attack.
- Looking on Udacity Knowledge, this appears to be a common problem - see e.g.
  https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/784769
  https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/741607
- Following the suggestion at https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/784769, I verified that the SSH commands were reaching the web server using:
  grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log
  The screenshot E3T1_auth_log.png shows the output from running this command
  N.B. Need to expand comments in the knowledge article to see the suggestion
- I tried various things such as:
  * leaving the attack running for several hours. I worked around SSH session timeouts by running the hydra command using nohup e.g.
    nohup hydra -l ubuntu -P rockyou.txt ssh://ec2-23-21-139-0.compute-1.amazonaws.com &
    Sample output shown in screenshot: E3T1_hydra_nohup.png
  * waiting for several hours before checking GuardDuty
  * changing 'Frequency for updated findings' setting, albeit this should not affect detection
  * generating sample findings to check GuardDuty enabled
  * recreating the detector
  * attacking the web server via both its public DNS and IP address as it looked from traceroute that traffic to the former was being routed internally
    (see screenshot: E3T1_traceroute.png)
  * verifying that GuardDuty is enabled and configured correctly for the correct region and account via the AWS CLI, using commands:
      aws guardduty list-detectors --profile default --region us-east-1
    then:
      aws guardduty get-detector --detector-id <id> --profile default --region us-east-1
    (see example output in screenshot: E3T1_detector.png)

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

GuardDuty detects EC2 SSH brute force attacks via the VPC logs - see:
